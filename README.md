# Frontend Web Developer Application

The html file is myApp.html

I used Sass for styling.

There are 3 products(3 smartphones). The customer
has a chance to see how many products that he/she
has clicked on(this is the value displayed
beside the cart), and at the same time see the total
cost/price of all products that have been clicked on.
 
 The "add to cart" button adds 1 element to the
 cart on every click.
 
 The customer can delete all items in the cart by
 clicking the "delete All" button.
 
 The customer can remove a particular element from
 the cart clicking on the "remove item" button
